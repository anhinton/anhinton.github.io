      <p>This articles explores the problem of helping people connect
	with data. In the first section I examine the importance of
	connecting people with data, and look at why people are not
	fully connected with data at present. In the second section I
	consider how software can contribute to solving this problem,
	and examine some software examples which may contribute to the
	solution. In the third section I give details of how the
	<cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> project intends to solve
	the problem.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1 id="theproblem">The problem</h1>

      <h2 id="whyhelppeople">Why help people connect with data</h2>

      <p>Decision-making in the Twenty-first Century is both
	characterised and complicated by an abundance of
	data. Increasing amounts of data are becoming available to the
	public through initiatives around open government and open
	data. Technology has not only made massive data collection and
	analysis possible, it has also delivered the means to store
	and analyse data into the hands and homes of ordinary
	people. Says Rufus Pollock of Open Knowledge, "what matters is
	having the data, of whatever size, that helps us solve a
	problem or address the question we have."
	(<cite key="Pollock2014a"></cite>Pollock, 2014)</p>

      <p>The need to help people connect with data has been recognised
	by institutions and governments throughout the world. In 1989
	the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL)
	Presidential Committee on Information Literacy described the
	challenges faced by society in the Information Age. They
	described the Information Age as an age of increasing
	abundance of information. The committee found that for people
	to gain benefit from these swiftly accumulating repositories
	of data they must be information literate. One cannot be
	information literate if one cannot "locate, evaluate, and use
	effectively" the data or information which is required to make
	good decisions (<cite key="acrl1989a"></cite>American Library
	Association. Presidential Committee on Information Literacy,
	1989).</p>

      <p>In 2009 the New Zealand Government recognised the importance
	of making data available by launching the website data.govt.nz
	to serve as a catalogue for publicly available government
	data. (<cite key="nzgovt2009a"></cite>Guy, 2009) In 2010 the
	Government released the New Zealand Government Open Access and
	Licensing framework (NZGOAL) to guide agencies in releasing
	their data, through data.govt.nz and otherwise. NZGOAL
	established standard, open and permissive licenses for
	government agencies to use for releasing data
	(<cite key="nzgovt2010a"></cite>Ryall, 2010). The NZGOAL
	framework was updated in 2015
	(<cite key="nzgoal2015a"></cite>"NZGOAL version 2 released",
	2015). In 2011 the Government further recognised the
	importance of data to a democratic society by making a
	commitment to "to releasing high value public data actively
	for re-use". (<cite key="nzgovt2011a"></cite>"Declaration on
	open and transparent government", 2011)</p>

      <p>The UK Government has also recognised the importance of
	making public data available, with the launch of the website
	data.gov.uk in 2010. The site was launched in recognition of
	government data as a public resource
	(<cite key="ukcabinet2010a"></cite>"Government launches
	one-stop shop for data", 2010).</p>

      <p>In 2014 the New Zealand Data Futures Forum (NZDFF) was
	established to advise government ministers on how the
	increasing amounts of government, business and personal data
	being collected, and made available, would effect the public
	service (<cite key="nzgovt2014a"></cite>English &amp;
	Williamson, 2014). In a discussion document the NZDFF
	establishes 'inclusion' as one of the four key values New
	Zealand should embrace in managing access to and use of
	data. (<cite key="nzdff2014a"></cite>New Zealand Data Futures
	Forum, 2014) The report states that "[a]ll parts of New
	Zealand society should have the opportunity to benefit from
	data use."  (<cite key="nzdff2014a"></cite>New Zealand Data
	Futures Forum, 2014, p. 10)</p>

      <p>It is not only the initiatives of large organisations and
	public institutions which demonstrate the need to help people
	connect with data. Individuals and small organisations are
	also working to increase access to and use of data. Open
	Knowledge is a non-profit organisation which sees data as a
	means "to make informed choices about how we live, what we buy
	and who gets our vote."  (<cite key="OK2015a"></cite>"Open
	knowledge: about", 2015) The organisation advocates for the
	release of data in open and permissive formats. It is also
	involved in educating businesses and individuals in the ways
	open data can be used in their work. </p>

      <p>Individuals and informal groups, too, are connecting with
	data, and helping other people to do so. In New Zealand people
	working on or interested in open government and open data
	projects can discuss and share their projects through the Open
	Government Ninjas discussion list
	(<cite key="opengovtninjas2015a"></cite>"Open New Zealand",
	2015;
	<cite key="opennz2015a"></cite>"The open government ninjas",
	2015). Around the world people participate in open data
	hackathons. Hackathons are events where people meet, often
	over several days, to work collaboratively and voluntarily on
	new applications for and visualisations of public data
	sets. These events are intended both to make use of open data,
	and to increase awareness of the availability and utility of
	these data
	sets. (<cite key="opendataday2015a"></cite>"International open
	data hackathon", 2015;
	<cite key="aucklandtransport2014a"></cite>"Hackathon winners
	make life easier for public transport users", 2014)</p>

      <h2 id="notenoughpeople">Not enough people are connecting with
	data</h2>

      <p>Many further examples could establish that people need and
	want to connect with data, and that they are in fact doing
	so. I will now focus on those people who are not currently
	connecting with data; I will further demonstrate that many
	people are still incapable of connecting with data. According
	the The UN Secretary General's Independent Expert Advisory
	Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development (IEAG),
	"[t]here are huge and growing inequalities in access to data
	and information and in the ability to use it"
	(<cite key="IEAG2014"></cite>The UN Secretary General's
	Independent Expert Advisory Group on a Data Revolution for
	Sustainable Development, 2014, p. 2). The ability to use data
	and information that will be the focus of these examples.</p>

      <p>While much more data is becoming available to the public,
	many people are unable to connect meaningfully with data due
	to their inability to access or make use of them; "[t]he sheer
	abundance of information will not in itself create a more
	informed citizenry without a complementary cluster of
	abilities necessary to use information effectively"
	(<cite key="acrl2000a"></cite>"Information literacy competency
	standards for higher education", 2000, p. 2). To be
	information literate a person must be able to "[access] needed
	information effectively and efficiently"
	(<cite key="acrl2000a"></cite>"Information literacy competency
	standards for higher education", 2000, p. 9). She must also be
	able to "[manipulate] data, as needed, transferring them from
	their original locations and formats to a new context."
	(<cite key="acrl2000a"></cite>"Information literacy competency
	standards for higher education", 2000, p. 13) The availability
	of data is of no help to someone who does not know how to
	access, or how to use these data.</p>

      <p>In its consultation with stakeholders the NZDFF "was struck
	by the low level of general awareness of what is currently
	occurring [in the areas of data collection, access and use]
	and the opportunities potentially available."
	(<cite key="nzdff2014a"></cite>, 2014, p. 56) NZDFF argues
	that "open data is of limited value to New Zealanders if they
	need a degree in statistics to be able to interpret it."
	(<cite key="nzdff2014a"></cite>New Zealand Data Futures Forum,
	2014, p. 57) NZDFF believes that New Zealanders require data
	literacy to gain benefit from open data. NZDFF acknowledges
	that data visualisation and the availability of data
	visualisation tools are central to helping people understand
	data, commenting that "[t]here is some activity in the market,
	but it is an area in which New Zealand could be a lot more
	proactive."  (<cite key="nzdff2014a"></cite>New Zealand Data
	Futures Forum, 2014, pp. 56-57)</p>

      <p><cite key="hinton_murrell2015a"></cite>Hinton and Murrell
	(2015a) believe that, beyond access to data, the following
	things are required for people to connect with data: domain
	knowledge, data science skills, statistical graphics skills
	and graphical design skills. While the participants in open
	data hackathons and on open data discussion list might possess
	several of these skills, it is far from common to find someone
	who possesses all of them. NZDFF suggests data journalism as a
	means to helping people make sense of
	data. (<cite key="nzdff2014a"></cite>New Zealand Data Futures
	Forum, 2014) However, during a 2010 data journalism hackathon,
	participant and journalist Jerry Vermanen confessed, the
	combination of journalistic skills and the skills needed to
	work with data was "not a common presence"
	(<cite key="datajournalismhandbook2015a"></cite>Vermanen,
	2015).</p>

    </div>
    <div>

      <h1 id="asoftwaresolution">A software solution</h1>

      <p>One way of helping people to connect with data is to design
	software for this purpose. Many software solutions already
	exist for manipulating and for analysing data; many of these
	are specialist in nature, and focus on solving particular sets
	of data problems in specific contexts.</p>

      <p>I believe a general framework for creating, describing, and
	executing data analysis workflows using computers is important
	for helping more people connect with data. I believe the
	following features are important in designing a system for
	describing and executing such workflows:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Workflows should be modular: workflows should be split
	  into components or nodes, each of which can be replaced with
	  another.</li>
	<li>Workflows can be easily reused and shared: it should be
	  easy to share workflows with other people, and for these
	  people to run workflows on their own machines.</li>
	<li>The system should be extensible: it should be easy for
	  users to create new nodes or components for use in
	  workflows, and it should be easy to share these nodes.</li>
	<li>The system should be open and free: the solution should be
	  freely available for users to access, use, modify and
	  share.</li>
	<li>The system should not be highly technical: it should be
	  possible for users to make use of workflows in the system
	  without having high levels of analysis and programming
	  skills.</li>
	<li>The system should not be monolithic: a user of the system
	  should not be stuck using the system exclusively.</li>
	<li>The ideal system is an infrastructure which meets the
	  previous criteria, and on which convenient interfaces can be
	  built; it is not just a convenient interface.</li>
	<li>The system should be aware of reproducible research: it
	  should be possible both to make use of scripts embedded in
	  reproducible research documents, and to embed the system's
	  workflows in such documents.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> project describes a
	framework for creating, sharing and executing workflows of
	data analysis called 'pipelines'. A 'pipeline' is comprised of
	several 'modules', each of which does a small task described
	by a script. Modules are connected by 'pipes' which connect
	one module's output to another module's inputs—this can be
	described visually by a directed node and edge graph. Modules
	and pipelines are described by lightweight XML documents which
	can easily be shared and executed by 'glue systems'
	(<cite key="hinton_murrell2015a"></cite>Hinton &amp; Murrell,
	2015a).</p>
      
      <p>Of course, <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> is not the
	only software project which might be used to help connect
	people with data. In the next several sections I will consider
	several software projects which might be used to solve this
	problem. I believe the projects I have chosen are
	representative of broader categories of software. The projects
	were also chosen based on our perception of how fair it was to
	test them using our criteria, as these criteria might not have
	been part of their design.</p>
      
      <p>First I will examine
	<cite key="knime2015software">KNIME</cite> (Version 2.11.3,
	2015), which I have chosen to represent the class of software
	which attempts to provide a visual programming interface to
	data analysis. Other examples of this class include
	<cite key="Ranalyticflow2015a">R Analytic Flow</cite> (2015)
	and
	<cite key="redR2010a">Red-R</cite> (2010).</p>

      <p>The second
	project, <cite key="giardine2005galaxy">Galaxy</cite>, is a
	web-based platform for performing bio-medical analysis. Though
	<cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> has very specific aims it
	has commonalities with other projects:
	like <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> it uses visual
	programming in parts of its interface; it is a web-based data
	analysis solution,
	like <cite key="opencpu2015a">OpenCPU</cite> (2015) and
	<cite key="Rcloud2015a">R Cloud</cite> (2015).</p>

      <p>Lastly I will examine
	<cite key="gapminder2015world">Gapminder World</cite> (2015),
	a web-based tool for viewing animated visualisations of
	countries' development statistics. This tool was chosen as a
	representative of websites and web-based tools which display
	visualisations of public data to help increase public
	knowledge through data. <cite key="wikinz2015a">Wiki New
	Zealand</cite> (2015) is another example of such a website. It
	is not our expectation that such web-based software will meet
	many of our desired features; these sites attempt to help
	connect people with data through data visualisations for
	analysis and discussion rather than by putting the full
	analysis suite in the users' hands. I hope that the
	examination of <cite class="software">Gapminder World</cite>
	will not seem unfair, but will rather serve to highlight some
	of the different approaches to the problem.</p>

      <p>For each of these projects I have attempted to create a
	simple workflow represented by three nodes:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>consume some data,</li>
	<li>processes these data, and,</li>
	<li>produces a visualisation of these data.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Guided by the list of desirable features for workflow
	software I have attempted to answer the following
	questions:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Can a user substitute the data node, the processing node,
	  or the visualisation node for another?</li>
	<li>Can the workflow be reused and shared?</li>
	<li>Can a user create new node? Can the user choose the
	  language used in the new node?</li>
	<li>How open is the software?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="knime"><cite class="software">KNIME</cite></h2>

      <p><cite class="software">KNIME</cite> is an open source
	application for managing data analysis. Data analysis
	workflows are divided into constituent nodes representing
	steps in the process. The workflow is created and managed in a
	visual programming environments using node and edge graphs to
	represents nodes and how information is passed between them
	(<cite key="knime2015quick"></cite>"KNIME quickstart guide",
	2015). I installed <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> version
	2.11.3 in Ubuntu 14.04 for the testing done below.</p>

      <p>To examine <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> I followed the
	instructions for 'Building a Workflow' in
	the <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> quickstart guide
	(<cite key="knime2015quick"></cite>"KNIME quickstart guide",
	2015, pp. 5–10). I did not include the 'Interactive Table'
	node described in the guide. I have (1) consumed data from the
	file '<a href="workflows/iris.csv">iris.csv</a>' using the
	'File Reader' node, (2) performed a cluster analysis on the
	data using the 'k-Means' node, and (3) produced a scatterplot
	of the results of the analysis using the 'Scatter Plot'
	node. It should be noted that I was unable to locate the
	'IrisDataSet' directory mentioned in the quickstart
	guide. Instead I used the file 'iris.csv', found in the
	'Example Workflow' directory
	which <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> creates in the first
	workspace nominated when
	running <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> for the first
	time.</p>

      <p>Nodes are selected from
	the <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> application's Node
	Repository panel, and are dragged with the mouse into the
	workflow editor. A node is connected to another by clicking
	and dragging from one node's output port to another node's
	input port. A node is configured by right-clicking and
	selecting 'Configure...'. A window appears in which the node
	can be configured. For example, configuring the 'File Reader'
	node from the quickstart guide allows the user to select a
	source file containing the data required. Nodes cannot be run
	until they have been configured.</p>

      <p>Workflows, or parts of workflows, are executed by right
	clicking a node and selecting 'Execute'. When executed a node
	will first execute all the nodes which precede it in the
	workflow, if they have been configured. If executing a node
	produces graphical outputs, as does the 'Scatter Plot' node,
	these outputs can be viewed by right-clicking the nodes and
	selecting the appropriate 'View:' option.</p>

      <p>The example workflow, including the 'iris.csv' data, has been
	exported and is available in
	<a href="workflows/quickstart_example_base.zip">quickstart_example_base.zip</a></p>

      <h3 id="knime_swapping">Swapping out nodes</h3>

      <p>Within <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> one node in a
	workflow can be substituted for another node using the same
	process as when a workflow is created. For step (1), a
	different data set can be selected by choosing a different
	source file in the 'File Reader' node's configuration. I have
	provided an example workflow where data is read from the file
	<a href="workflows/kyphosis.csv">kyphosis.csv</a>.  This file
	was produced from the 'kyphosis' dataset
	in <cite class="software">R</cite>. The workflow created with
	this dataset was exported to
	<a href="workflows/quickstart_example_data.zip">quickstart_example_data.zip</a>.
	For step (2) a 'Fuzzy c-Means' node replaces the 'k-Means'
	node (exported to
	<a href="workflows/quickstart_example_process.zip">quickstart_example_process.zip</a>).
	For step (3) a 'Scatter Matrix' node replaces the 'Scatter
	Plot' node (exported to
	<a href="workflows/quickstart_example_plot.zip">quickstart_example_plot.zip</a>).
	These workflows were all variations on the original
	workflow.</p>

      <h3 id="knime_reuse">Reuse and sharing</h3>

      <p>Workflows can be exported
	from <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> via the menu command
	'File &gt; Export KNIME Workflow...'. The workflow to be
	exported is selected from a workflow browser window. The file
	to which the workflow is to be exported is selected through a
	file browser window. Data can be embedded in the exported
	file, or excluded by selecting 'Exclude data from export'
	(<cite key="knime2015quick"></cite>"KNIME quickstart guide",
	pp. 20–21).</p>

      <p>Workflows exported in this manner can be imported into
	<cite class="software">KNIME</cite> using the menu command
	'File &gt; Import KNIME Workflow...'. The user selects 'Select
	archive file' in the dialog window, and specifies the archive
	file using a file browser window
	(<cite key="knime2015quick"></cite>"KNIME quickstart guide",
	pp. 19–20).</p>

      <p>The exported workflows in the previous section were all
	exported with their data embedded. The example workflow for
	our basic example has been exported without data embedded for
	the sake of comparison at
	<a href="workflows/quickstart_example_base_nodata.zip">quickstart_example_base_nodata.zip</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="knime_creating">Creating new nodes</h3>

      <p>Nodes in <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> are created
      using a customised version of
	<cite class="software">Eclipse</cite> IDE plugins
	(<cite key="knime2015dev"></cite>"Developer guide", 2015,
	Section 1). I have noted that while a process for creating new
	nodes which are native to <cite class="software">KNIME</cite>
	exists, the process of creating our own native nodes is beyond
	the scope of this paper. Rather, I have investigated whether
	new nodes can be created from
	existing <cite class="software">R</cite>
	scripts. <cite class="software">R</cite> objects can be used
	in <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> by installing the
	'KNIME Interactive R Statistics Integration' extension. To
	install this extension the user selects
	the <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> menu item 'File &gt;
	Install KNIME Extensions...', types 'R Statistics' into the
	filter pane, selects 'KNIME &amp; Extensions &gt; KNIME
	Interactive R Statistics Integration', and clicks 'Next'. The
	user should then follow the on-screen instructions to complete
	the installation (<cite key="knime2015update"></cite>"KNIME
	update site", 2015).</p>

      <p><cite class="software">KNIME</cite> then has
	an <cite class="software">R</cite> menu in its 'Node
	Repository' pane. I have attempted to create a node for step
	(3) of our workflow, which will plot the results of the
	k-means analysis using <cite class="software">R</cite>. I used
	the 'R View (Table)' node, which "[a]llows execution of an R
	script from within KNIME. The view resulting from this script
	is returned in the output image port of this node"
	(<cite key="knime2015software">KNIME</cite> version 2.11.3,
	2015, Help: R View (Table)).  This node provides a data frame
	called 'knime.in' to the <cite class="software">R</cite>
	script. The script is provided to the node through its
	configuration window. The
	following <cite class="software">R</cite> script was provided

      <h2 id="galaxy"><cite class="software">Galaxy</cite></h2>

      <p><cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> is a web-based platform
	for performing bio-medical data analysis. Analyses are
	arranged in 'Histories', consisting of the initial datasets,
	the transformed data at every step in the analysis, and the
	final dataset. The user selects 'Tools' to transform or
	analyse datasets and return another dataset. 'Workflows'
	describe the steps performed in an analysis, but do not
	contain the datasets produced
	(<cite key="galaxy2015learn"></cite>"Learn Galaxy", 2015). I
	assessed <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> using the public
	instance
	at <a href="https://usegalaxy.org/">https://usegalaxy.org/</a>. It
	is not necessary to register an account to use this instance,
	but Histories and Workflows will not be preserved if a user
	does not log in.</p>

      <p>To examine <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> I attempted
	to reproduce an analysis similar to the analysis done
	for <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> above. I (1) loaded
	the data, (2) converted the data to another format, and (3)
	plotted the data. For step (1) I loaded the
	'<a href="workflows/iris.csv">iris.csv</a>'
	into <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> by selecting 'Get
	Data &gt; Upload File from your computer' from the 'Tools'
	panel. I selected 'Choose local file' and selected 'iris.csv'
	using the file browser. I clicked 'Start', and then
	'Close.' <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> loaded the file,
	and displayed the result in the History panel.</p>

      <p>The tools in <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> are focused
	on genetic analysis. As I have no experience in this area I
	opted not to use any of the tools, as I am unable to
	meaningfully assess their output. As such our step (2)
	consists of transforming our data to a tab-separated format. I
	selected 'Text Manipulation &gt; Convert delimiters to TAB'
	from the 'Tools' panel. From the subsequent dialog I selected
	'Convert all &gt; Commas', and 'In Dataset: 1: iris.csv', then
	selected 'Execute'.</p>

      <p>Finally, step (3), I plotted the data. I selected
	'Graph/Display Data &gt; Scatterplot of two numeric
	columns'. I selected '2: Convert on data 1' for the Dataset,
	'Column: 1' for the x axis, and 'Column: 3' for the y axis,
	and clicked 'Execute'. I was able to view the resulting
	scatterplot by selecting the 'View data' icon from '3:
	Scatterplot on data 3' in the 'History' pane.</p>

      <p>This History was exported to file
	as <a href="workflows/Galaxy-History-examplebase.tar.gz">Galaxy-History-examplebase.tar.gz</a></p>

      <h3 id="galaxy_swapping">Swapping out Tools</h3>

      <p>Within <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> a new tool can be
	added to a History using the process described above. For step
	(3) the 'Graph/Display Data &gt; Histogram of a numeric
	column' tool replaces 'Scatterplot' in the exported History
	<a href="workflows/Galaxy-History-exampleplot.tar.gz">Galaxy-History-exampleplot.tar.gz</a>.
	This new 'History' was created by selecting 'History options
	&gt; Copy History' from the 'History' pane.</p>

      <p>Due to our lack of familiarity with the tools
	in <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> we have not provided
	an example where step (2) has been substituted.</p>

      <p>As <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite> stores the results of
	tool transformations as data sets I employed a different
	approach to substituting the data step. First, a 'Workflow'
	was extracted from our original example by selecting 'History
	options &gt; Extract Workflow' from the 'History' pane, then
	selecting 'Create workflow' on the subsequent page. A new
	'History' was created by choosing 'History options &gt; Create
	New' from the 'History' pane. The data
	file <a href="workflows/kyphosis.csv">kyphosis.csv</a> was
	uploaded to the 'History' the same as in the earlier
	example. The 'Workflow' extracted earlier was run, by
	navigating to the 'Workflow' page and selecting run from the
	drop-down menu of the 'Workflow' created on this page. On the
	subsequent page '1: kyphosis.csv' was selected as the Input
	Dataset. This failed to run, as the 'kyphosis.csv' did not
	have numeric data in the columns selected by the Scatterplot
	tool in the extracted 'Workflow'. 'Run this job again' was
	selected from the failed Scatterplot object in the 'History'
	pane, and two 'Column: 2' was selected for the x axis. The
	resulting 'History' has been exported as
	<a href="workflows/Galaxy-History-exampledata.tar.gz">Galaxy-History-exampledata.tar.gz</a>.
	The extracted 'Workflow' has been exported as

      <h2 id="gapminderworld"><cite class="software">Gapminder
      World</cite></h2>

      <p><cite class="software">Gapminder World</cite> is an online
      application which uses the
	<cite class="software">Trendalyzer</cite> software project to
	display time series of countries' development statistics
	(<cite key="gapminder2015about"></cite>"About Gapminder",
	2015). The resulting graphic is an interactive bubble
	chart. The user can select two datasets to be plotted along
	the x- and y-axes. The bubble plotted for each country vary in
	size according to a third dataset to be selected by the
	use. These three datasets are plotted for a given year; the
	user can change the year displayed, or the graphic can be
	played, which animates the changes in the data over time. The
	user can choose to view a pre-prepared graph from a menu, or
	can select the datasets to be displayed through drop-down
	menus. The software comes with a large range of datasets, but
	new datasets cannot be loaded into the system by the user.</p>

      <p>While <cite class="software">Gapminder World</cite> allows
	the user to display different combinations of datasets, the
	workflow of the software is essentially fixed. However it is
	suggested on Gapminder's 'Frequently Asked Questions' page for
	that a user can use Google's Motion Chart Gadget to produce an
	animated bubble chart with the user's choice of data
	(<cite key="gapminder2015faq"></cite>"Frequently asked
	questions (FAQ)", 2015). Therefore, rather than examine
	<cite class="software">Gapminder World</cite> directly I have
	followed the instructions on displaying data using a Google
	Motion Chart
	(<cite key="gapminder2015motionchart"></cite>"Quick guide to
	the Motion Chart", 2015). Motion Chart is part of the
	<cite class="software">Google Drive</cite>
	(<a href="https://encrypted.google.com/drive/">https://encrypted.google.com/drive/</a>)
	software platform; use of this software requires a Google
	account. I have attempted to recreate the graph
	<cite key="gapminder2015mortality"></cite>"Is child mortality
	falling?" (2015) from <cite class="software">Gapminder
	World</cite>.</p>

      <p>The data sources for this example, provided by
	<cite class="software">Gapminder World</cite>,
	are <cite key="gapminder2015gd001"></cite>"GDP per capita by
	purchasing power parities" (2015),
	<cite key="gapminder2015gd002"></cite>"Infant mortality rate"
	(2015), and <cite key="gapminder2015gd003"></cite>"Total
	population" (2015). The <cite class="software">Excel</cite>
	files provided by these sources are available at
	<a href="workflows/gd001-gdp-per-capita.xlsx">gd001-gdp-per-capita.xlsx</a>,

	and
	<a href="workflows/gd003-total-population.xlsx">gd003-total-population.xlsx</a>.</p>

      <p>The first step (1) was to load the data into
	a <cite class="software">Google Drive</cite> spreadsheet. This
	involved copying the data from
	the <cite class="software">Excel</cite> data files into the
	spreadsheet directly, or preparing a spreadsheet in some other
	software and importing it into
	<cite class="software">Google Drive</cite>. Due to the manual
	nature of this task only four countries were plotted;
	Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and United Kingdom. No
	explicit data processing step (2) was performed. The data was
	plotted and animated (3) by selecting 'Insert &gt; Chart &gt;
	Trend &gt; Motion Chart' in the open spreadsheet
	in <cite class="software">Google Drive</cite>. The 'Infant
	Mortality Rate' data was selected for the x-axis, 'GDP' data
	for the y-axis. A log transformation was selected for both of
	these axes. The bubble 'Size' and 'Color' were set to
	'Population'. The spreadsheet used in this example, along with
	the resulting motion chart, are available at
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Og-yUSVCx0s_S3Hrw97l0O5HHynyQy8dJJjjYkOyNFA/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Og-yUSVCx0s_S3Hrw97l0O5HHynyQy8dJJjjYkOyNFA/edit?usp=sharing</a>;
	the axis transformations and choices of bubble size and colour
	are not preserved in the shared link, and must be manually set
	whenever the sheet is opened.</p>

      <h1 id="theopenapisolution">The <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite>
      solution</h1>

      <p>The aim of the <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> project
	is to create a software framework which helps to connect
	people with data. By choosing representatives of several
	classes of possible software solutions I have identified
	several ways in which current software does not meet the
	requirements I have identified:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Visual programming software solutions, such
	  as <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> are somewhat
	  monolithic in that to take advantage of these systems a user
	  must commit to using this system somewhat
	  exclusively. Extension of workflows in these systems tends
	  to be technically demanding.</li>
	<li>Web-based software solutions, such
	  as <cite class="software">Galaxy</cite>, also tend to
	  require that the user commit to using this particular piece
	  of software, and are technically demanding to extend.</li>
	<li>Online visualisation sites,
	  like <cite class="software">Gapminder World</cite>, do not
	  provide modular workflows for sharing and reuse. While they
	  provide useful output for helping people to understand
	  particular datasets they are not useful for exploring new
	  data sets or producing customised variations of
	  analyses.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> is a framework for
	creating, executing, and sharing data workflows. It consists
	of three main parts:</p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <em>Modules</em> which represent simple tasks,</li>
	<li>
	  <em>Pipelines</em> which describe a workflow consisting of
	  several modules, and,</li>
	<li>
	  <em>Glue systems</em> which read and execute modules and
	  pipelines.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> modules and pipelines
	are specified using XML. Module XML wraps a script which
	describes a job to be done in a language
	like <cite class="software">R</cite>
	or <cite class="software">Python</cite>. The module XML
	describes the inputs required by this script, and the outputs
	it will produce. Pipeline XML consists of a list of modules,
	and of <em>pipes</em>; a pipe describes how a module's output
	is to be provided as another module's input. Pipelines allow
	the user to create simple and complex workflows. A glue system
	is any software which can read module and pipeline XML,
	execute the wrapped module scripts, and provide module outputs
	as inputs described in the pipeline XML
	(<cite key="hinton_murrell2015a"></cite>Hinton &amp; Murrell,
	2015).</p>

      <p>To examine <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> I have
	created a pipeline which employs the same steps as
	the <cite class="software">KNIME</cite> example above. In step
	(1) I read data in from the
	<a href="workflows/iris.csv">iris.csv</a> CSV file, in step
	(2) I perform a k-means cluster analysis, and in step (3) I
	plot the results of this analysis. The pipeline XML file
	created for this example can be found
	at <a href="workflows/conduit/conduit_base/pipeline.xml">pipeline.xml</a>.
	Step (1) consists of two modules,
	<a href="workflows/conduit/conduit_base/iris_csv.xml">iris_csv.xml</a>
	and
	<a href="workflows/conduit/conduit_base/readCSV.xml">readCSV.xml</a>.
	The processing step (2) was done by the module
	<a href="workflows/conduit/conduit_base/kmeans_cluster.xml">kmeans_cluster.xml</a>.
	The plotting step (3) was done by the
	module <a href="workflows/conduit/conduit_base/clusterplot.xml">clusterplot.xml</a>.</p>

      <p>The example pipeline and its modules were executed using the
	'develop' branch of the prototype glue system
	'<a href="https://github.com/anhinton/conduit/tree/develop">conduit</a>',
	an <cite class="software">R</cite> package, as it was on
	2015-06-19. This was installed
	in <cite class="software">R</cite> Version 3.2.0 64-bit on an
	Ubuntu Linux 14.04 machine. A tarball of the version of
	'conduit' used is available at
	<a href="workflows/conduit_package_demo.tar.gz">conduit_package_demo.tar.gz</a>.
	The <cite class="software">R</cite> code used to run the
	'conduit' example pipelines can be found at
	<a href="workflows/conduit-examples.R">conduit-examples.R</a>.
	This closely follows the instructions for using 'conduit'
	version 0.1 (<cite key="hinton2015a"></cite>Hinton, 2015). The
	plot produced by the basic example can be found at
	<a href="workflows/pipelines/conduit_base/modules/clusterplot/Rplots.pdf">Rplots.pdf</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="openapi_swapping">Swapping out modules</h2>

      <p><cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> pipelines are modular;
	each module in a pipeline can be replaced by another module or
	pipeline of modules. To swap out a module a user replaces the
	module component XML of the module being replaced, and the
	pipes connecting this module's inputs and outputs, in the
	pipeline XML file. The replacement module(s) must consume
	appropriate inputs and produce appropriate outputs; where the
	desired replacement module does not consume or produce
	appropriate inputs or outputs
	the <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> framework makes it
	possible to provide conversions to appropriate inputs and
	outputs by means of further modules.</p>

	pipeline with a different data source (1) and its modules can

      <p>Modules and pipelines are described using XML files, which
	can easily be shared with other users. The pipeline archives
	in the previous section, and the basic example
	<a href="workflows/conduit/conduit_base.tar.gz">conduit_base.tar.gz</a>
	can be unpacked and executed on any machine capable of running
	the 'conduit' package. Modules may also refer to text source
	scripts which can be shared as easily as the module XML.</p>

      <h2 id="openapi_creating">Creating new modules</h2>

      <p><cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> workflows are
	extensible, as new modules can be easily created by wrapping a
	script in module XML. The XML used in module and pipeline
	files can be read and understood by humans as well as
	machines; <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> users do not
	need to have technical knowledge beyond XML formatting to use
	or create modules and
	pipelines. <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> module XML
	allows scripts to be entered directly into the XML, or a
	script file can be reference by file location
	(<cite key="hinton_murrell2015a"></cite>Hinton &amp; Murrell,
	2015). The modules used to demonstrate swapping out modules in
	the <a href="#openapi_swapping">earlier section</a> were all
	created in this manner.</p>

      <p>Authors of new <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> modules
        are limited to the languages supported by the glue system used
        to execute pipelines and modules. The 'conduit' package
        currently
        supports <cite class="software">R</cite>, <cite class="software">Python</cite>,
        and shell scripts. Authors of glue systems can choose which
        language source scripts they will support.</p>

      <h2 id="openapi_accessibility">Accessibility and openness</h2>

      <p><cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> is open and free: the
	pipeline and module XML frameworks are described in a publicly
	shared document specification; developers are free to write
	software which can
	consume <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> XML files. There
	is no single <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> glue system
	software; rather the <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite>
	framework asks that any glue system meet certain requirements,
	which include being able to execute a pipeline's module
	scripts in the intended order
	(<cite key="hinton_murrell2015a"></cite>Hinton &amp; Murrell,
	2015).</p>

      <p>The 'conduit' package for <cite class="software">R</cite> is
	a prototype glue system which is available for users to
	install locally under a GPL open source license
	(<cite key="hinton_murrell2015b"></cite>Conduit Version 0.1-1,
	2015). The 'conduit' package has only been tested on Ubuntu
	Linux 12.04 and 14.04 machines at present. This package is in
	an early stage of development and is not easy for
	non-technical users to install and use.</p>

      <p><cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> is designed as an
	infrastructure for creating, executing and sharing data
	workflows, while not demanding that a user be trapped in
	the <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> system by using
	it. In fact, <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> attempts to
	make it possible to capture scripts and workflows from authors
	who had not been working with any knowledge
	of <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite>. Further, modules and
	pipelines are capable of preserving the details of their
	source scripts' inputs and outputs information as XML, meaning
	the workings of an <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite>
	module or pipeline can be easily consumed by software other
	than an <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> glue system
	(<cite key="hinton_murrell2015a"></cite>Hinton &amp; Murrell,
	2015).</p>

    <div class="conclusion">

      <h1 id="conclusion">Summary</h1>

      <p>As data literacy becomes a basic requirement for
	participation in society, helping to connect people with data
	is an increasingly important problem. I believe a software
	solution to this problem should be</p>

      <ul>
	<li>modular</li>
	<li>reusable</li>
	<li>shareable</li>
	<li>open and free</li>
	<li>not overly technical</li>
	<li>not monolithic</li>
	<li>compatible with reproducible research</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I have examined and assessed several software projects with
	potential to help solve this problem in terms of the features
	listed, and found that no single project appears to encompass
	all of these features. I have described how
	the <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> project addresses
	all of these features to solve the problem. I have
	demonstrated the <cite class="software">OpenAPI</cite> system
	by demonstrating the use of a prototype glue system,
	'conduit'.</p>
